# TMDB-movie-data-analysis
Data analysis project based on TMDb movies — includes data scraping, cleaning, and visualization of ratings, vote_count, and popularity trends using Python.

###  Project Overview

The **TMDb Movie Data Analysis** project focuses on exploring and understanding trends in **movie ratings, vote count, and popularity** using data collected through the TMDb API. The dataset was cleaned, analyzed, and visualized using Python and Excel to uncover insights about audience preferences and factors that influence a movie’s success.

## About the Project

This project analyzes TMDb movie data to study how ratings, votes, and popularity are related across different years and genres. Instead of traditional web scraping, an **API key** was used to fetch the movie data directly, ensuring reliable and faster collection. The data was cleaned and processed using Python libraries, and several visualizations were created to understand audience engagement and rating patterns.

##  Objectives

* Collect movie data from TMDb using an API key.
* Clean and prepare data using Pandas.
* Study relationships between **ratings, vote count, and popularity**.
* Visualize the data to identify patterns and correlations.
* Export the processed data and visuals to Excel for easy presentation.

---

##  Key Features

* API-based data collection for accurate and real-time data.
* Data cleaning and transformation using Pandas.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for understanding trends.
* Graphical insights using **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Excel**.
* Visualizations include bar plots, heat maps, stacked bars, scatter plots, and pair plots.

##  How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/TMDb-movie-data-analysis.git
   cd TMDb-movie-data-analysis
   ```

2. **Install required libraries:**

   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn requests
   ```

3. **Open the notebook:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook TMDb_analysis.ipynb
   ```

4. **Run all cells** to perform the full analysis and generate visualizations.
   The cleaned dataset and results can be exported to Excel for reporting.

##  Visualizations Used

* **Bar Plot:** Compared average ratings by language.
* **Heat Map:** Analyzed correlation between rating, vote count, and popularity.
* **Stacked Bar:** Compared popularity categories and average ratings.
* **Scatter Plot:** Showed relationships between year, rating, and popularity.
* **Pair Plot:** Displayed multivariate relationships between rating, votes, and popularity.

---

##  Insights & Learnings

* Movies with higher **vote counts** tend to maintain consistent ratings.
* **Popularity** and **ratings** show a positive correlation in most decades.
* Certain genres consistently attract high popularity regardless of ratings.
* Visualization helps interpret audience preferences more effectively.
